SECTION 1.2 TEASER — Dimensional Modeling (Kimball)

Title:
Section 1.2 Preview — Dimensional Modeling (Kimball) for Modern Data Architects

Post Body:
Section 1.2 of the Data Architect Workbook is now in development, and this chapter focuses on one of the most practical, high‑leverage skills in analytics engineering:

Two‑word logic:
Business First

Dimensional modeling is not about tables — it’s about capturing business questions in analytical form.
This section breaks the topic into four high‑impact, real‑world challenges every architect must master:

Q1 — Star Schema for Sales Analytics
How to design a clean, high‑signal star schema that supports revenue, margin, and operational KPIs without over‑modeling or leaking business logic into the warehouse.

Q2 — SCD Strategy Selection (Type 1/2/3/6)
A practical decision framework for choosing the right Slowly Changing Dimension strategy — not by theory, but by business impact, auditability, and downstream consumption patterns.

Q3 — Fact Table Grain Definition
The most important decision in dimensional modeling.
This section teaches a grain‑first algorithm to eliminate ambiguity, prevent double‑counting, and ensure every metric is reproducible.

Q4 — Conformed Dimensions Across Domains
How to design dimensions that stay consistent across Sales, Finance, Marketing, and Operations — the foundation of cross‑domain analytics and enterprise‑wide truth.

Two‑word principle:
Clarity Wins

Dimensional modeling is where architecture meets business reality.
This chapter focuses on practical templates, debugging‑first logic, and Kimball‑aligned patterns that scale across teams and platforms.

If you want this section to include more examples, diagrams, SQL patterns, or domain walkthroughs, let me know — I’m building the workbook publicly, and your feedback shapes the next release.

Section 1.2 drops next. Section 1.1 is already live on GitHub.
